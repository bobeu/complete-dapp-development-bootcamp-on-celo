# complete-dapp-development-bootcamp-on-celo
<!-- Complete dapp development bootcamp on Celo: move from intermediate to advance level with step by step guides -->

# Introduction
Welcome to the Celo-Dapp development course which takes you from the intermediate stage to building advanced decentralized applications on the Celo blockchain. This course is designed and organized in paths with hands-on tasks to give you a smooth learning experience. There will be a total of 62 pathways divided into two main sub-pathways. Thirty-one (31) paths will be text-based, while the rest will come in explanatory videos.  Completing each path and the associated tasks is the key to unlocking the next path. The BootCamp is carefully designed to give you the top-notch skills you need to build your dream project on the Celo blockchain. Each pathway is meant to build upon another hence audiences are advised to take it step by step. At the end of this course, you will earn a **[certificate of participation]()** verifiable on the Celo mainnet.

# Who can attend this course
To attend this course, you must have been exposed to blockchain in general including concepts such as DeFi, ReFi, SocialFi, GamiFy, etc.  It's okay if you're not that knowledgeable in this field, but the course assumes you are at least a beginner in smart contracts development using solidity.
If you're above the beginner stage, it allows you to choose which path you fit in, and you can skip those parts that aren't new to you. 

# The Goal
Aligning with the goal of the Celo foundation and that of the Celo community, the course is specially designed to nurture your web3 development skills to confidently build production-ready decentralized applications targeted at the CELO blockchain. 

# What do I stand to gain?
You will learn:
* Smart contracts in-depth.
* Best practices for writing smart contracts.
* Gas-efficient ways of writing smart contracts.
* Smart contract optimization techniques.
* More advanced way of using web3 tools such as Truffle, Hardhat, Foundry, etc.
> Note: I may choose to use either Foundry or Hardhat or Truffle.

* More advanced way of working with web3 libraries and framework such as EtherJs, Web3Js, Web3Onboard, Web3React, Wagmi, etc.
* You will be able to build and test your dream project (s) on the test and main networks. 
* How to use Celo-based tools in your projects such as the ContractKits, etc.
* Advanced smart contract development using.
     - Solidity
     -  Yul
     - Inline assembly.
     - Pre-compile contracts etc.

> [I will visit each chapter with details and code examples]().

*Additional skills you will gain*

* How to build a simple frontend for your DApps.  
* Working with frontend libraries like ReactJs, Typescript, Nextjs, and MaterialUI.
* Build self-confidence.
